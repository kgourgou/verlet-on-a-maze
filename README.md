# Literally applying the verlet method on a graph that defines a maze. 

The motivating example for this was a maze represented as a graph. We have vertices V and edges E 
as well as an additional attribute of the vertices, their location in 2D space. 

To play with `run_pymaze.py` you will need to install my version of [pymaze](https://github.com/kgourgou/pymaze).

This is not yet useful in any way, there are some TODOs that I have to take care of.
